# COVID-19_Python-Project#

DETAILS ABOUT PROJECT : Pandemics are alwqays deadly no matter the shapes it tkes or geographical area it affects but nothing is as deadly as lacking the knowledge or data about it perhaps knowing how to tackle it.
   We are all aware of the adverse effects the corona virus had on both the economy and our personal lives couple of years back and attached to this are the slides showing the statistics sorrounding it ranging from;
* Total cases,
* Death cases,
* Countries with highest number of cases with the respective year in review (As United States of America are the stats leader) and other necessary and impotant stats like that.

DETAILS ON HOW WE DID IT: Each slides shows detailed information and step by step code/syntax we used on the raw data before taking it to FLOURISH to visualize and by using tools like :
-- PANDAS,
-- NUMPY,
--MATPLOTLIB
(All in the Jupiter Notebook)
While some of the functions used are (.shape),(.info),(.Unique) which are (all descriptive) and all ran to show us the type and properties of the raw data before going deep into it and some other functions like :
-- isnull.sum() to check blank columns,
-- .is in() for checking wrongly spelt data and other necessary functions like that.

AIM & OBJECTIVES:
-- havin the data and Knowing there is an alarming high number of total cases and death draws the attention and raises the awareness of the world to it faster thereby finding solution to it.
-- Knowing the mostly affected geographical region (countries) helps in easy decision making and knowing where is the priority to disperse the cure if there is any available,
-- it helps in knowing how to educate the general public on preventive measures especially the most affected countries and e.t.c

TOOL USED : PYTHON (Jupiter Notebook for code/syntax)
TOOL USED : FLOURISH ( For Visualization)
